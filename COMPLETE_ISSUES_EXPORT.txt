TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY
================================================================================

The 6-layer system implements a sophisticated AI architecture for automated 
ideation and evolution:

L0 (Signal Ingestion): Harvests diverse signals from 9 axes (Reddit, TikTok, 
GitHub, arXiv, Patents, Crunchbase, SEC, Wellness, Design) and builds a 
dynamic knowledge graph with clustering.

L1 (Macro-Allocation): Dynamically allocates crawl budget to axes and compute 
budget to clusters using UCB bandit algorithms and GRPO cluster selection.

L2 (Dialogue-Pod Runtime): Multi-stage ideation pipeline with LLM-based agents 
(Creators, Critics, Judges, Specialists) for idea generation, refinement, 
debate, ranking, and financial/compliance verdicts.

L3 (Meta-Review & Evolution): Aggregates scored ideas into MAP-Elites grid, 
performs genetic crossover and AZ mutation to generate offspring ideas.

L4 (Reinforcement Learning): Continuously improves system through bandit 
updates, GRPO policy training, AZ-LoRA fine-tuning, and DPO optimization.

L5 (Observability & Governance): Comprehensive monitoring, cost controls, 
security compliance, and human oversight capabilities.
