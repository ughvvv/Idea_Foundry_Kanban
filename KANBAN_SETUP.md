- **Human Jury Integration**: Governance and oversight tools

## 📊 Views and Filters

Create custom views for different perspectives:

### 1. By Layer View
- **Filter**: Group by layer labels (L0, L1, L2, etc.)
- **Sort**: By priority, then by creation date

### 2. Sprint View
- **Filter**: Current milestone + "Sprint Ready" or "In Progress"
- **Sort**: By priority

### 3. Blocked Items View
- **Filter**: "Blocked" column or "Status:Blocked" label
- **Sort**: By creation date (oldest first)

### 4. Component View
- **Filter**: Group by component labels
- **Sort**: By layer, then priority

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Create the project** following the steps above
2. **Set up labels** using the provided label system
3. **Create issue templates** in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
4. **Configure automation rules** for workflow management
5. **Create milestones** for project phases
6. **Start creating issues** using the [Task Breakdown](./TASK_BREAKDOWN.md)

## 💡 Best Practices

- **Consistent Labeling**: Always use layer + type + component labels
- **Clear Titles**: Format as `[LAYER]: Brief descriptive title`
- **Linked Issues**: Reference related issues and PRs
- **Regular Updates**: Keep issue status and progress updated
- **Milestone Tracking**: Assign issues to appropriate milestones
- **Documentation**: Link to relevant documentation in issue descriptions
