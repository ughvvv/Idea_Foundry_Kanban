# Ideation Engine - Multi-Layer AI System Architecture

A comprehensive AI-driven ideation and evolution system with 6 distinct layers covering signal ingestion, resource allocation, dialogue-based ideation, meta-evolution, reinforcement learning, and governance.

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

This project implements a sophisticated multi-layer architecture for automated ideation and continuous improvement:

- **L0: Signal Ingestion & Knowledge-Graph Pipeline** - Harvests diverse signals from 9 axes (Reddit, TikTok, GitHub, arXiv, Patents, Crunchbase, SEC, Wellness, Design)
- **L1: Macro-Allocation Layer** - Dynamic resource allocation using UCB bandits and GRPO cluster selection
- **L2: Dialogue-Pod Runtime** - Multi-agent LLM system with Creators, Critics, Judges, and Specialists
- **L3: Meta-Review & Evolution Loop** - Genetic algorithms and MAP-Elites for idea evolution
- **L4: Reinforcement & Fine-Tuning** - Continuous learning via GRPO, AZ-LoRA, and DPO
- **L5: Observability, Security & Governance** - Monitoring, cost controls, and human oversight
