## 📋 Best Practices

### Label Usage Guidelines

1. **Always use layer labels**: Every issue should have exactly one layer label
2. **Always use type labels**: Every issue should have exactly one type label
3. **Use component labels**: Add relevant component labels for better filtering
4. **Set priority**: Assign appropriate priority based on business impact
5. **Update labels**: Keep labels current as issues evolve

### Issue Template Guidelines

1. **Choose the right template**: Select the template that best matches your work
2. **Fill out all sections**: Complete all relevant sections for clarity
3. **Link related issues**: Always reference related work
4. **Define acceptance criteria**: Make success measurable
5. **Consider dependencies**: Identify and document dependencies early

### Automation Benefits

- **Consistent labeling**: Automated label sync ensures consistency
- **Improved searchability**: Well-labeled issues are easier to find
- **Better reporting**: Labels enable powerful filtering and reporting
- **Team efficiency**: Templates ensure all necessary information is captured
